# Find the first or last occurrence of a given number in a sorted array
# Given a sorted integer array, find the index of a given numberâ€™s first or last occurrence. 
# If the element is not present in the array, report that as well.

# binary search for target value
# binary search again to left for first occurrence, to right for last occurrence

# 11:44
# implemented regular binary search for target in 7 minutes
